They really could cost you your job if you don t stop all this tweeting at night. Then Musk cried Why The tweets I wrote are not mean I don t use all caps and I m sure that my tweets are clean. But your tweets can move markets and that s why we re sore. You may be a genius and a billionaire but it doesn t give you the right to be a bore S I broke the window. Q What did I break S I gracefully saved the day. Q What did I gracefully save S I gave John flowers. Q Who did I give flowers to S I gave her a rose and a guitar.

R. Firth 1957 11 One of the most successful ideas of modern statistical NLP When a word w appears in a text its context is the set of words that appear nearby within a fixed size window . We use the many contexts of w to build up a representation of w government debt problems turning into banking crises as happened in 2009 saying that Europe needs unified banking regulation to replace the hodgepodge India has just given its banking system a shot in the arm These context words will represent bankingWord vectors We will build a dense vector for each word chosen so that it is similar to vectors of words that appear in similar contexts measuring similarity as the vector dot scalar product Note word vectors are also called word embeddings or neural word representations They are a distributed representation banking 0.286 0.792 0.177 0.107 0.109 0.542 0.349 0.271 monetary 0.413 0.582 0.007 0.247 0.216 0.718 0.147 0.051 19Word meaning as a neural word vector visualization 0.286 0.792 0.177 0.107 0.109 0.542 0.349 0.271 0.487 expect 203. Word2vec Overview 21 Word2vec Mikolov et al. 2013 is a framework for learning word vectors Idea We have a large corpus body of text a long list of words Every word in a fixed vocabulary is represented by a vector Go through each position t in the text which has a center word c and context outside words o Use the similarity of the word vectors for c and o to calculate the probability of o given c or vice versa Keep adjusting the word vectors to maximize this probabilityWord2Vec Overview Example windows and process for computing 𝑃𝑤𝑡 𝑗 𝑤𝑡 crises banking into turning problems as center word at position t outside context words in window of size 2 outside context words in window of size 2 𝑃𝑤𝑡 1 𝑤𝑡 22 𝑃𝑤𝑡 2 𝑤𝑡 𝑃𝑤𝑡 1 𝑤𝑡 𝑃𝑤𝑡 2 𝑤𝑡Word2Vec Overview Example windows and process for computing 𝑃𝑤𝑡 𝑗 𝑤𝑡 crises banking into turning problems as center word at position t outside context words in window of size 2 outside context words in window of size 2 𝑃𝑤𝑡 2 𝑤𝑡 𝑃𝑤𝑡 1 𝑤𝑡 23 𝑃𝑤𝑡 2 𝑤𝑡 𝑃𝑤𝑡 1 𝑤𝑡Word2vec objective function For each position 𝑡 1 𝑇 predict context words within a window of fixed size m given center word 𝑤𝑡. Data likelihood The objective function 𝐽𝜃is the average negative log likelihood Minimizing objective function Maximizing predictive accuracy sometimes called a cost or loss function 24Word2vec objective function We want to minimize the objective function Question How to calculate 𝑃𝑤𝑡 𝑗 𝑤𝑡 𝜃 Answer We will use two vectors per word w 𝑣𝑤when w is a center word 𝑢𝑤when w is a context word Then for a center word c and a context word o 25Word2Vec with Vectors 𝑃𝑢𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑠 𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑜 Example windows and process for computing 𝑃𝑤𝑡 𝑗 𝑤𝑡 short for P 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑠 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑜 𝑢𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑠 𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑜 𝜃 crises banking into turning problems as center word at position t outside context words in window of size 2 outside context words in window of size 2 𝑃𝑢𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑜 𝑃𝑢𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑠 𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑜 𝑃𝑢𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑠 𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑜 𝑃𝑢𝑡𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑜 All words vectors 𝜃 appear in denominator 26Word2vec prediction function The softmax function maps arbitrary values 𝑥𝑖to a probability distribution 𝑝𝑖 max because amplifies probability of largest 𝑥𝑖 soft because still assigns some probability to smaller 𝑥𝑖 Frequently used in Deep Learning But sort of a weird name because it returns a distribution 27To train the model Optimize value of parameters to minimize loss To train a model we gradually adjust parameters to minimize a loss Recall 𝜃represents all the model parameters in one long vector In our case with d dimensional vectors and V many words we have è Remember every word has two vectors We optimize these parameters by walking down the gradient see right figure We compute all vector gradients 284. 293031325. Optimization Gradient Descent We have a cost function 𝐽𝜃we want to minimize Gradient Descent is an algorithm to minimize 𝐽𝜃 Idea for current value of 𝜃 calculate gradient of 𝐽𝜃 then take small step in direction of negative gradient. Repeat. Note Our objectives may not be convex like this L But life turns out to be okay J 33Update equation in matrix notation Update equation for single parameter Algorithm Gradient Descent 𝛼 step size or learning rate 35Stochastic Gradient Descent Problem 𝐽𝜃 So is a function of all windows in the corpus potentially billions is very expensive to compute You would wait a very long time before making a single update Very bad idea for pretty much all neural nets Solution Stochastic gradient descent SGD Repeatedly sample windows and update after each one Algorithm 36Word2vec maximizes objective function bc putting similar words nearbc in space 37How to evaluate word vectors 38 Related to general evaluation in NLP Intrinsic vs. extrinsic Intrinsic Evaluation on a specific intermediate subtask Fast to compute Helps to understand that system Not clear if really helpful unless correlation to real task is established Extrinsic Evaluation on a real task Can take a long time to compute accuracy Unclear if the subsystem is the problem or its interaction or other subsystems If replacing exactly one subsystem with another improves accuracy à WinningMeaning similaritc Another intrinsic word vector evaluation 39 Word vector distances and their correlation with human judgments Example dataset WordSim353 http www.cs.technion.ac.il gabr resources data wordsim353 Word 1 Word 2 Human mean tiger cat 7.35 tiger tiger 10 book paper 7.46 computer internet 7.58 plane car 5.77 professor doctor 6.62 stock phone 1.62 stock CD 1.31 stock jaguar 0.92Classification review and notation 40 Supervised learning we have a training dataset consisting of samples xi yi Ni 1 xi are inputs e.g. words indices or vectors sentences documents etc. Dimension d yi are labels one of C classes we try to predict for example classes sentiment named entities buy sell decision other words later multi word sequencesNeural classification Typical ML stats softmax classifier Learned parameters θ are just elements of W not input representation x which has sparse symbolic features Classifier gives linear decision boundary which can be limiting compose our data multiple times giving a non linear classifier A neural network classifier differs in that We learn both W and distributed representations for words The word vectors x re represent one hot vectors moving them around in an intermediate layer vector space for easy classification with a linear softmax classifier Conceptually we have an embedding layer x Le We use deep networks more layers that let us re represent and But typically it is linear relative to the pre final 41 layer representationSoftmax classifier Again we can tease apart the prediction function into three steps 1. For each row y of W calculate dot product with x 2. Apply softmax function to get normalized probability softmax 𝑓 𝑦 3. Choose the y with maximum probability For each training example x y our objective is to maximize the probability of the correct class y or we can minimize the negative log probability of that class 4243 Thanks.
