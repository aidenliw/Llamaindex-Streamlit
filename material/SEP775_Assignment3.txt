McMaster University SEP 775 Assignment 3 TANDA Approach for QA System Enhancement Objectives Explore TANDA Transfer And Adapt methodology to improve Question Answering QA systems using pre trained Transformer models focusing on sequential fine tuning te chniques. 1. Introduction and Theory 15 Summarize the TANDA methodology s principles focusing on its novelty and the rationale behind sequential fine tuning. Discuss how Transformers architecture benefits the TANDA approach. 2. Preparation and Dataset Understanding 15 Select the ASNQ dataset for the transfer learning step and either WikiQA or TREC QA for domain specific adaptation. Conduct an exploratory data analysis EDA on your chosen datasets to understand their structure content and challenges. 3. Model Implementation 30 Implement a baseline Transformer model for comparison. Apply the TANDA two step fine tuning process First fine tune on the ASNQ dataset. Then adapt the model to your chosen domain specific dataset. Document the modifications made to the original Transformer architecture if any and justify your choices. 4. Experimental Setup and Evaluation 20 Describe your experimental setup including training details e.g. hyperparameters loss functions optimization strategy . Evaluate both the baseline and TANDA enhanced models using appropriate metrics accuracy F1 score etc. . Analyze the performance impact of the TANDA approach compared to the baseline model. 5. Discussion and Conclusion 20 Discuss any challenges encountered during implementation and how they were ad dressed. Reflect on the effectiveness of the TANDA approach for QA systems and potential areas for improvement. Propose future research directions or applications of the TANDA methodology in other NLP tasks.
