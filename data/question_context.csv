By restricting the self-attention mechanism to attend to local neighborhoods we significantly increase the size of images the model can process in practice, despite maintaining significantly larger receptive fields per layer than typical convolutional neural networks. While conceptually simple, our generative models significantly outperform the current state of the art in image generation on ImageNet, improving the best published negative log-likelihood on ImageNet from 3.83 to 3.77.",Paper

What method did GPT-3 use to improve its translation performance in few-shot settings?,"LAMBADA is also a demonstration of the flexibility of few-shot learning as it provides a way to address a problem that classically occurs with this dataset. Although the completion in LAMBADA is always the last word in a sentence, a standard language model has no way of knowing this detail. It thus assigns probability not only to the correct ending but also to other valid continuations of the paragraph. This problem has been partially addressed in the past with stop-word filters [RWC+19] (which ban ?????continuation????? words). The few-shot setting instead allows us to ?????frame????? the task as a cloze-test and allows the language model to infer from examples that a completion of exactly one word is desired.",Paper

In the standard Cloze task (Taylor, 1953), the goal is to predict masked-out text based on its context. ICT instead requires predicting the inverse?????given a sentence, predict its context.",Paper
What challenges does ORQA address in open-domain question answering?,"We address these challenges by carefully initializing the retriever with unsupervised pre-training (Section 4). The pre-trained retriever allows us to (1) pre-encode all evidence blocks from Wikipedia, enabling dynamic yet fast top-k retrieval during fine-tuning (Section 5), and (2) bias the retrieval away from spurious ambiguities and towards supportive evidence (Section 6).",Paper
How does the performance of ORQA compare to traditional IR systems like BM25 on datasets where questioners genuinely seek answers?,"On datasets where question writers do not know the answer?????Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), WebQuestions (Berant et al., 2013), and CuratedTrec (Baudis and Sediv??y, 2015)?????we show that learned retrieval is crucial, providing improvements of 6 to 19 points in exact match over BM25.",Paper
